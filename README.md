# TalkToMeInKorean-api

Hello there or 안녕하세요, this is the backend for the Talk to Me In Korean project built in React.

Now this back end is honestly nothing crazy and is really only designed to store and handle the things a backend should do

This backend is a REST API built using Node.js/Express and MongoDB as the database

Right now the plan for this backend is for it to be very minimal, it may grow as the application as a whole could have the potential to be picked and worked on upon further but as of right now this backend is simply designed to support the front-end/React App as a place to store and process data
