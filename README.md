# TalkToMeInKorean-api

Hello there or 안녕하세요, this is the backend for the Talk to Me In Korean project built in React.

Now this back end is honestly nothing crazy and is really only designed to store and handle the things a backend should do.

Right now the plan for this backend is for it to be very minimal, it may grow as the application as a whole could have the potential to be picked and worked on upon further but as of right now this backend is simply designed to support the front-end/React App as a place to store and process data

So there was a huge update to this project, since my last roll out. I haven't had a ton of time to work on this project
but after getting AWS Solutions Architect certified, my job decided to move me around which gave me some time to work on this project.
The main change is that I switched the API to use Python/Flask instead Node/Express. I personally love Python but haven't had much time/oppurtunities to use it as mostly everything I do is in JS, also the Python driver for mongo is just a lot more user friendly.
